ICD-9 codes appear numeric but leading and trailing zeroes, and both decimal and non-decimal \"short\" format codes exist. The package enables a work flow from raw lists of ICD-9 codes from hospital billing databases to comorbidities. ICD-9 to comorbidity mappings from Quan (Deyo and Elixhauser versions), Elixhauser and AHRQ included. Any other mapping of codes, such as ICD-10, to comorbidities can be used.\r\n\r\nRelevance\r\n---------\r\n\r\nICD-9 codes are still in heavy use around the world, particularly in the USA where the ICD-9-CM (Clinical Modification) is in widespread use. ICD-10 and the corresponding ICD-10-CM are imminent, however a vast amount of patient data is recorded with ICD-9 codes of some kind: this package enables their use in R. A common requirement for medical research involving patients is determining new or existing comorbidities. This is often reported in *Table 1* of research papers to demonstrate the similarity or differences of groups of patients. This package is focussed on fast and accurate generation of this comorbidity information from raw lists of ICD-9 codes.\r\n\r\nICD-9 code types\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nICD-9 codes are not numbers, and great care is needed when matching individual codes and ranges of codes. It is easy to make mistakes, hence the need for this package. ICD-9 codes can be presented in *short* 5 character format, or *decimal* format, with a decimal place separating the code into two groups. There are also codes beginning with V and E which have different validation rules. Zeroes after a decimal place are meaningful, so numeric ICD-9 codes cannot be used in most cases. In addition, most clinical databases contain invalid codes, and even decimal and non-decimal format codes in different places. This package primarily deals with ICD-9-CM (Clinical Modification) codes, but should be applicable or easily extendible to the original WHO ICD-9 system.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\n\r\nSee the vignette and code help for many more. Here's a taste:\r\n\r\n``` r\r\npatientData\r\n#>   visitId  icd9  poa\r\n#> 1    1000 40201    Y\r\n#> 2    1000  2258 <NA>\r\n#> 3    1000  7208    N\r\n#> 4    1000 25001    Y\r\n#> 5    1001 34400    X\r\n#> 6    1001  4011    Y\r\n#> 7    1002  4011    E\r\n\r\n# reformat input data as needed\r\npatientData %>% icd9LongToWide # everything works well with magrittr %>%\r\n#>      [,1]    [,2]   [,3]   [,4]   \r\n#> 1000 \"40201\" \"2258\" \"7208\" \"25001\"\r\n#> 1001 \"34400\" \"4011\" NA     NA     \r\n#> 1002 \"4011\"  NA     NA     NA\r\n\r\n# get comorbidities:\r\nicd9ComorbidQuanDeyo(patientData)\r\n#>         MI   CHF   PVD Stroke Dementia Pulmonary Rheumatic   PUD LiverMild\r\n#> 1000 FALSE  TRUE FALSE  FALSE    FALSE     FALSE     FALSE FALSE     FALSE\r\n#> 1001 FALSE FALSE FALSE  FALSE    FALSE     FALSE     FALSE FALSE     FALSE\r\n#> 1002 FALSE FALSE FALSE  FALSE    FALSE     FALSE     FALSE FALSE     FALSE\r\n#>         DM  DMcx Paralysis Renal Cancer LiverSevere  Mets   HIV\r\n#> 1000  TRUE FALSE     FALSE FALSE  FALSE       FALSE FALSE FALSE\r\n#> 1001 FALSE FALSE      TRUE FALSE  FALSE       FALSE FALSE FALSE\r\n#> 1002 FALSE FALSE     FALSE FALSE  FALSE       FALSE FALSE FALSE\r\n\r\n# find diagnoses present on admission:\r\nicd9FilterPoa(patientData)\r\n#>   visitId  icd9\r\n#> 1    1000 40201\r\n#> 4    1000 25001\r\n#> 6    1001  4011\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that reformatting from wide to long and back is not as straightforward as using the various Hadley Wickham tools for doing this: knowing the more detailed structure of the data let's us do this better for the case of dealing with ICD codes.\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe latest version is available in [github](https://github.com/jackwasey/icd9) and can be installed with:\r\n\r\n    install.packages(\"devtools\") # if needed\r\n    devtools::install_github(\"jackwasey/icd9\")\r\n\r\n    install.packages(\"magrittr\") # recommended, but not required\r\n\r\nThe *master* branch at github should always build and pass all tests and R CMD check, and will be similar or identical to the most recent CRAN release. The CRAN releases are stable milestones. Contributions and bug reports are encouraged.\r\n",
